My name is Andreas Ågren and I'm a developer from Malmö in south Sweden, where I live with my wife and son.
I work at [Apptus Technologies AB][1] with integration. My day-to-day technologies are C#, SQL Server, ASP.NET, Java and Javascript.
I am very passionate about software development and I love learning, reading about and practicing it.

The name Include Brain originates from a joke between me and my brother sometime during early 2000. At the time I studied C++,
and if you're a developer you might know that files are imported with e.g. `#include <foo.h>`

We were at [Dreamhack][2] and, possibly after I got my ass handed to me in Quake 3 by a twelve year old, I suggested that
some people really should `#include <brain.h>`

Being perfectly reasonable, my brother printed this on a cap:

![Include brain cap][3]

If you would like to get in touch with me, there are a number of options on the [About][4] page.

I hope you will enjoy my writings!
